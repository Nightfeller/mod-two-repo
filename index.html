    <div class="am">
     <p>I am Peter Matthew Earls. I am 18 years old and a work-in-progress developer.</p>
     <p>I have never had a job before and not currently looking for one. I have been doing work at a coding bootcamp and before that, was in a coding school for game developers. One of my dream is to become a game developer and modder and create games/mods that are for the community, without any of the monotization that the prominent game companies have been doing lately.</p>
     <p>I've had autism since the day that I was born. I also like fantasy settings and video games, which are some of the reasons why I want to be a developer. I have been homeschooled most of my life, and I like the idea of being self-taught. However, I am okay with being taught by someone else.</p>
